# Excel-VBA-for-Business-and-Pleasure
This is a collection of snippets of VBA Macros I created for work. The idea is that as presented here they are generalized enough so that you can drop them into your own projects or use them as they are with little to no modification. They are also commented so it's clear what is going on so if you do want to modify them it won't be too difficult.
